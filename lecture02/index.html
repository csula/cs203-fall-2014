   <li>To solve problems using recursion </li>
   <li>To use an overloaded helper method to design a recursive method
</li>
   <li>To discover the relationship and difference between recursion and iteration </li>
   <li>To know tail-recursive methods and why they are desirable </li>
</ul>

<h3>What is Recursion?</h3>

<p>Recursion is a technique that leads to elegant solutions to problems that are difficult to program using simple loops.</p>

<p>Recursive methods are methods that invoke themselves.</p>

<h3>Compute Factorial</h3>

<p>Let us compute $f(n) = n!$ </p>

<p>Note that the <em>base case</em> are also known as the <em>stopping condition</em>.</p>

<h3>Thinking Recursion</h3>

<p>All recursive methods have the following characteristics:</p>

<ul> 
  <li>The method is implemented using an if-else or a switch statement that leads to different cases.</li>
  <li>One or more base cases (the simplest case) are used to stop recursion.</li>
  <li>Every recursive call reduces the original problem, bringing it increasingly closer to a base case until it becomes that case.</li>
</ul>

<p>To solve a problem using recursion, you break it into subproblems. Each sub-problem is the same as the original problem but smaller in size. You can apply the same approach to each subproblem to solve it recursively. </p>

<h3>Recursive Helper Methods</h3>

<p>Sometimes you can find a solution to the original problem by defining a recursive function to a problem similar to the original problem. This new method is called a recursive helper method. The original problem can be solved by invoking the recursive helper method.</p>

<p>In the above example <b>isPalindrome(...)</b> has two function signatures, the second method is said to be the "helper method" to assist the first method by overloading its parameters.</p>

<h3>Recursion vs. Iteration</h3>

<p>Recursion is a loops without the repitition of a control statement.
  Here are some characteristics of recursion (when comparing with iterations):</p>

<ul>
  <li>All recursive algorithm can be solved nonrecursively with iterations.</li>
  <li>Recursions has overheads because entry into methods require new scope, thus overheads.</li>
  <li>Recursion can help obtain clear, simple solution for an inherently recursive problem that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. </li>
  <li>Recursion is often more elegant.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tail Recursion</h3>

<p>Tail recursion is an different approach to recursion.  The general
  idea is to improve performance.  Tail recursion occurs when there
  is no more pending operations when returning from a recursive
  function call.</p>

<p> Let's transform the factorial example from non-tail to tail
  recursive method.</p>

<h2>Lab Exercises</h2>

<p>For each of the following exercises, practice developing and running your program with Eclispe.  Note that the lab assignments are not graded.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write a recursive mathematical definition for computing $x^n$ for a positive integer $n$ and a real number $x$.  Then write a corresponding Java program.</li> 
  <li>Write a recursive method <b>reverseDisplay(String s)</b> that reverses the order of $s$.</li>
  <li>Write a recursive method <b>reverseDisplay(int k)</b> that reverses digit of $k$.</li>
</ol>
