<h1>CS203: Programming with Data Structure</h1>

<p>This is an individual exam, therefore no collaboration.  If you are caught cheating, <strong>you will receive an F for the course</strong>. This is NOT negotiable.</p>

<h2>Final Exam</h2>

<p>You may refer to your notes, the class website, and your textbook.  However, you are not allowed to search the Internet for an answer, nor are you permitted to discuss the exam with anyone else through email, instant messengers, or any other means.</p>

<h3>Programming Part</h3>

<p>Consider the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/csula/cs203-fall-2014/tree/master/src/quiz3">final</a>.  Your task is to update the file <b>Relationship.java</b>:</p>

<ol>
  <li> Write the code for the <b>SocialNetwork(...) { ... }</b> constructor such that it reads in the social network data file. </li>
  <li> Write the code for the <b>getRelationshipType(...) { ... }</b> method such that it determines the relationship type between the two names.  If there is no relationship then a -1 is returned. </li>
  <li> Write the code for the <b>hasConnection(...) { ... }</b> method such that it determines if there is a connection between two names.  A connection can be direct or indirect.  For example, person A has a relationship with person B, and person B has a relationship with person C.  Therefore, person A has a connection to person C. </li>
</ol>

<p>You are <b>NOT</b> allowed to modify the abstract classes, i.e. <b>Graph</b>, <b>Edge</b>, and <b>Vertex</b>.  You may change <b>Person</b>, <b>Relationship</b>, and <b>SocialNetwork</b>.  Your code must execute as followed.</p>

</div>

<p>The code as provided will read "network.txt" by default.  So you SHOULD NOT CHANGE <b>public static void main(String args[])</b>.  You are probably asking yourself, should I change <b>main(...)</b>?  The answer is NO!  In case you're wondering if it's necessary to change <b>main(...)</b>.  The answer is still NO!  You really really want to change <b>main(...)</b>.  Go ahead and do it. But do not submit that as the solution to the exam.  So finally, just a quick reminder, in case you are not aware, do not change <b>main(...)</b>.</p>

<p>Submit all your source code, jar file, and your network.txt file.</p>

<h3>Analysis Part</h3>

<p>1. What is the time complexity (use Big O) for determining the relationship type given two names? </p>

<p>2. What is the time complexity (use Big O) for determining if there is a connection between two names?</p>

<p>3. Assuming that you can modify any of the classes, recommend a way in which we can improve the performance. Please be as detail as possible.</p>
