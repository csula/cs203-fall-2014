<h1>CS203: Programming with Data Structure</h1>

<p>This is an individual exam, therefore no collaboration.  If you are caught cheating, <strong>you will receive an F for the course</strong>. This is NOT negotiable.</p>

<h2>Final Exam</h2>

<p>You may refer to your notes, the class website, and your textbook.  However, you are not allowed to search the Internet for an answer, nor are you permitted to discuss the exam with anyone else through email, instant messengers, or any other means.</p>

<h3>Programming Part</h3>

<p>Consider the source code here: http://github.com/csula/.  Your task is to write a <b>SocialNetwork</b> class and fill in the missing information.</p>
