<h2>Course Policy</h2>

<h3>Grading Allocations</h3>
<ul>
    <li>4 homework programming assignments: 40 points (10 points each)</li>
    <li>2 exams: 20 points (10 points each)</li>
    <li>1 final exam: 20 points</li>
    <li>1 final project: 20 points</li>
</ul>

<h3>Course Project</h3>
<p>Throughout this quarter we will be building a course project. This project is a cumulation of the homework assignments.</p>

<h3>Grading Scale</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A:  94 to 100</li>
    <li>A-: 90 to 93</li>
    <li>B+: 85 to 89</li>
    <li>B:  80 to 84 <br/></li>
    Graduate students will receive NC (No Credit) for scores below 80
    <li>B-: 77 to 79</li>
    <li>C+: 74 to 76</li>
    <li>C:  70 to 73 <br/></li>
    Undergraduates will receive NC (No Credit) for scores below 70
</ul>

<h3>Late Work</h3>
<p>After an assignment deadline has passed, CSNS will not accept work so students must email it to the instructor.  Any work turned in any way other than by CSNS will be treated as late, even if it is on time.  <b>For each day the assignment is late, the student will lose 1 point.</b></p>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<p><b>Cheating on assignments and exams will not be tolerated.</b>  All parties involved will receive a grade of <b>F</b> for the course and be <b>reported</b> to the Computer Science Department.</p>
