<h1>CS203: Programming with Data Structure</h1>

<h2>Lecture 5 / Sets and Maps</h2>
<p>Reading assignment: chapter 21</p>

<h2>Lesson Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To store unordered, nonduplicate elements using a set</li>
  <li>To explore how and when to use HashSet, LinkedHashSet, or TreeSet to store a set of elements.
  <li>To compare the performance of sets and lists</li>
  <li>To tell the differences between Collection and Map and describe when and how to use HashMap, LinkedHashMap, or TreeMap to store values associated with keys</li>
</ul>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>A set is an efficient data structure for storing and processing nonduplicate elements. A map is like a dictionary that provides a quick lookup to retrieve a value using a key.</p>

<div class="task">
What are some examples of when we'd use a set?
</div>

<p>You can create a set using one of its three concrete classes: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, or TreeSet.</p>

<h4>HashSet</h4>

<p>The HashSet class is a concrete class that implements Set. You can create an empty hash set using its no-arg constructor or create a hash set from an existing collection.</p>

<p>If you construct a HashSet with a set <em>load factor</em>.  This determines the capacity of a set before allocating for more space.</p> 

<div class="code"><pre>
public class HashTest {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Set<String> set = new HashSet<String>();
    set.add( "john" );
    set.add( "mary" );

    for (String s : set) {
       System.out.println(s);
    }
  }
}

</div>

<div class="task">
Write a program to continuously generate for a random number between 1 and 100.  Do not stop until all values have been randomly generated.
</div>

<p> You can also interrogate a set for information. For example <strong>set.size()</strong>.</p>

<div class="task">
Using eclipse find out what are some of the useful set's methods.
</div>

<h4>LinkedHashSet</h4>

<p>LinkedHashSet extends HashSet with a linked-list implementation that supports an order- ing of the elements in the set. The elements in a HashSet are not ordered, but the elements in a LinkedHashSet can be retrieved in the order in which they were inserted into the set.</p>

<h4>TreeSet</h4>

<p>If you require that access to a set based on a certain range or constraints, you can use TreeSet.  For example <strong>treeSet.first()</strong> and <strong>treeSet.last()</strong>.</p>

<h3>Maps</H3>

<p>A map is a container object that stores a collection of key/value pairs. It enables fast retrieval, deletion, and updating of the pair through the key. A map stores the values along with the keys. The keys are like indexes.</p>

<h4>HashMap</h4>

<p>A hash without concerning about the ordering.</p>

<h4>LinkedHashMap</h4>

<p>A hash without concerning about the ordering.</p>

<h4>TreeHashMap</h4>

<p>A hash that is efficient when you need traverse in order.</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
public class hashmap {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
     Hash<String, Integer> hash = new HashMap<String>();
     hash.put("john", 20);
  }
}
</pre></div>

<p>So some of the most practical applications for hash maps include the ability to quickly look things up, e.g. a dictionary or a lookup table.</p>

Redesign our homework assignment so that a roadnetwork can use road name as a hash key.
