<h1>CS203: Programming with Data Structure</h1>

<h2>Homework 2</h2>

<p>Revision: 1.0</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>For the previous assignment, we've put together the "plumbing" required for our roadnetwork infrastructure.  For the most part you <em>should</em> be able to navigate and manipulate the road network asset.  For this assignment, we're going to take the next step, which is to put together an "end-to-end" product that can acquire data, manipulate (process) and render results (visualize).  On the surface, this task might seem daunting at first, but remember how we tackle the first homework assignment in class: we take one component at a time.</p>

<p>With the website openstreetmap.org, we can easily obtain the road network information.  Your first non-programming task is to understand the data format that this website provides.  This requires that you (visit the site) and download/export a sample data file.  For more information on what the format look like take a look at my blog.  Next, you will need to parse this file and get to the required (relevant?) data.  This step goes hand in hand with the designing (modification) of your data composite data structure.  Let's take a look at a possible example how you might tackle this problem.</p>

<h3>Programming Task</h3>

<p>Write a Java program that does the following:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Read the road network information from an <strong>osm</strong> obtained from openstreetmap.org</li>
    <li>Determine possible locations to place your cellphone towers such that coverage is maximized.</li>
    <li>Generate 2D drawing (<b>map.png</b>) of the model conveying the following:
     <ol>
       <li>The road network and cellphone towers</li>
       <li>The signal strength eminating from each tower</li>
     </ol>
  <li>Generate a text report (<b>report.txt</b>) of the model</li>
</ol>

<h4>Cell Tower Placement</h4>

<p>We consider the following constraints when determining the placement of the cell towers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each tower can only be placed on a point in the <strong>osm</strong> file</li>
  <li>Each point can only accomodate at most one tower</li>
  <li>The best configuration for cell tower placement is chosen base best coverage result</li>
</ul>

<p>Coverage rate is calculated as percentage of the road that has signal.  Consider the following example of a road that has three segments and each segment is discretized into 100 points:</li>

<ul>
  <li>Segment $s_1$ has 25 discretization points without a signal</li>
  <li>Segment $s_2$ has 50 discretization points without a signal</li>
  <li>Segment $s_3$ has 100 discretization points wihtout a signal</li>
</ul>

<p>The overall coverage for this road is:</p>

$$
  C = \frac{75 + 50}{300} = 42 \%
$$

<p>The above example assumes that all segments are of the same length.  This not the case.  In fact, as we've demonstrated in class that using a fixed $K$ for discretization is not going to work for those segments are longer than others.  So let us consider a better model for discretization by fixing the distance between discretization points: $\delta = 0.001$.  This will invariably require that you rewrite (overide) the discretization method to take $\delta$ as an argument and calculate $K$.</p>

<h4>Report File</h4>

<p>Your report will include the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Listing of the cell towers, their position, radius, and the roads they cover</li>
  <li>The roads must be identified names and each road will display the percentage of coverage</li>
  <li>The final determination if the placement of the towers sufficient cover all roads: "success" or "dropsignal"</li>
</ul>

<p>So an example report file would look like this:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
C 1 100.01 200.01 0.04 
  40%	Valley Blvd
  25%	Garfield Ave
  10%	Rosemead Blvd
C 2 102.10 200.2 0.09
  100%  Rosemead Blvd
  10%   Garfield
  40%   Valley Blvd
</pre></div>

<p>Your report should report things as followed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first configuration (combination of cell towers) that provides 100% coverage</li>
  <li>If there is no configurations with 100% coverage then print the configuration that has best coverage</li>
</ul>

<h3>Analysis Task</h3>

<p>In addition to writing the code, your team will run some experiments and perform analysis on your tower-placement algorithm. In particular please discuss the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the overall time complexity of your algorithm? Please use $O(cn^k)$ notation</li>
  <li>You should run timing experiment to support claim above; for example if you claim $O(n)$ then show how your timing scale linearly as the number of points or cell tower grows</li>
  <li>Run experiments and characterize performance:
    <ol> 
     <li>varying $\sigma = \{ 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 \}$ </li>
     <li>for each $\sigma$'s vary the number of towers to be placed from 3 to 7</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Submission Guide</h3>

<p>Please submit all your java source code and a runable jar file (<b>hw2.jar</b>).  It is highly recommended that you test your java program from the command line as follower:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
java -jar hw2.jar road.osm map.png 5 0.1
</pre></div>

<p>If everything works as expected, then your program should generate the required files.</p>
