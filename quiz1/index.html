    <h1>CS203: Programming with Data Structure</h1>

<p>This is an individual exam, therefore no collaboration.  If you are caught cheating, <strong>you will receive an F for the course</strong>. This is NOT negotiable.</p>

<h2>Quiz 1</h2>

<p><strong>Parts 1 and 2</strong>: closed books, closed notes, and closed to your neighbor's exam. <br/>
<strong>Part 3</strong>: you may refer to your notes, the class website, and your textbook.  However, you are not allowed to search the Internet for an answer, nor are you permitted to discuss the exam with anyone else through email, instant messengers, or any other means.</pre>

<h3>Part 1</h3>
<p>Each question correctly answered is worth 5 points. No partial credit.</p>

<p>1. Which of the following statement about the characteristics of recursive programming is <em>not</em> correct?

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
   <li>The method is implemented using an if-else or a switch statement that leads to different cases.</li>
   <li>One or more base cases (the simplest case) are used to stop recursion.</li>
   <li>Recursive programs is highly efficient.</li>
   <li>Every recursive call reduces the original problem, bringing it increasingly closer to a base case until it becomes that case.</li>
</ol>

<p>2. The key benefit of generics is to enable errors to be detected at <em>runtime</em> rather than at <em>compile</em> time.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>true</li>
    <li>false</li>
</ol>

<p>3. Which of the following <em>is not likely</em> a cause of infinite recursion? 

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Incorrect base case.</li>
    <li>Parameters being passed into a recursive method does not change.</li>
    <li>Recursive method is not static.</li>
    <li>none of the above</li>
</ol>

<p>4. Which of the following statement is <em>not</em> true? 

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>All recursive algorithm can be solved nonrecursively with iterations.</li>
  <li>Recursions has low overheads thus more efficient than iterations.</li>
  <li>Recursion can help obtain clear, simple solution for an inherently recursive problem that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. </li>
  <li>Recursion is often more elegant.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Part 2</h3>
<p>Each question correctly answered is worth 10 points. Partial credit may be given if you show work.</p>

<p> 1. Explain the difference between <strong>bounded</strong> vs. <strong>unbounded</strong> generic type.</p>

<p> 2. Explain the difference between <strong>ArrayList</strong> and <strong>LinkedList</strong>.</p>

<p> 3. Explain the difference between <strong>queue</strong> and <strong>priority queue</strong>.</p>

<p> 4. Give time <em>O(n)</em> for the following operations on a linked list: (a) add an item to a linked list, (b) find an item in a linked list.</p>

<h3>Part 3</h3>
<p>Each question correctly answered is worth 20 points. Partial credit may be given if you show work.</p>

<p>Please refer to the folder <strong>quiz1</strong> found at <strong>https://github.com/csula/cs203-fall-2014</strong> and do <strong>two</strong> of the <strong>three</strong> tasks below.  If you answer all three parts, only the first two will be graded.</p>

<p> 1. Update the method <strong>recursivePrint(...)</strong> such that it recursively prints the entire linked list.</p>

<p> 2. Update the method <strong>findPosition(...)</strong> such that it finds the position for the supplied parameter.  You do not need to use recursion for this question.</p>

<p> 3. Update the method <strong>findLongestName(...)</strong> such it prints out the longest name from the linked list.  You not need to use recursion for this question.</p> 

<p><strong>Submission:</strong>: You must submit only two files: <strong>LinkedList.java</strong> and <strong>quiz1.jar</strong>.  <em>You will not receive any credit if you do not upload the source code.</em>  Make sure that your program can be easily executed as followed:</p>
